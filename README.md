# medium.com-bot
A medium.com bot with threading that does everything for you, it registers alone, and follows you, I'll be soon adding claps aswell and customized replies, pretty neat.
<h1> How does it work? </h1>
All you need is BeautifulSoup, Requests and Selenium, everything else it does alone, it'll use requests to request a login link, then it'll use GuerrilaMail's API to fetch the email link which then with BeautifulSoup we extract and then Selenium does it's own thing.
As I've said before I'll be adding clapping & comments within 24 hours. If you got questions, message me on reddit u/ddm50
